# Energy Planner

Plan when your devices should be switched on or off based on electricity price.

## Introduction

This is an add-on for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), which runs a background
job every hour. This job:
* Downloads the latest electricity prices
* If prices are available for the next day it runs planning for your devices
* Planning optimizes at what times your devices should be turned on and off on the next day
* It saves the electricity prices and plans in `/config/data/energy-planner`
* The files in that directory can then be used to create virtual sensors in Home Assistant that
  trigger your automation to turn your devices on and off

## Download

Connect to your Home Assistant with SSH. In the SSH session, do the following:

* Change to the Add-ons directory:
  ```
  cd /addons
  ```
* Clone the repository:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/patrsc/energy-planner.git
  cd energy-planner
  ```

## Customize

If desired, you can adjust the add-on by changing its files:
* In `energy_planner/config.py` you can adjust basic settings such as the repo where electricity
prices should be obtained from.
* You can also adjust `CustomPriceAdapter` there to change the algorithm how to download an process
electricity prices.
* You can also implement additional devices (see `Settings.devices` and the `devices` folder).
* The default device is a water boiler (`boiler.py`) which should be turned on in a window of
3 hours per day where electricity prices are lowest. If there is a problem in downloading price
data, 2 hours before the "deadline" 0:00 a fallback plan will be computed for the next day
(turning on the boiler at fixed time from 12:00 to 15:00).
